Thank you for your interest in contributing to the project!
First, read this page to learn the prerequisites for participation.

1.  In order to contribute to the repository, you will need to
    become a member of the spectrum-access-system-contributors
    team in the Wireless-Innovation-Forum GitHub organization.
    To become a member, you will need to create a GitHub account.
    Before we can approve your membership, you will need to
    sign a contributor license agreement.

    If you are an individual, please use the agreement in the
    file CLA-INDIVIDUAL. If you are representing a corporation,
    please use the agreement in CLA-CORPORATION. Contact a member
    of the spectrum-access-system-admin team in the organization
    for assistance. The agreement can be signed by copy-pasting
    the form into an email to lee.pucker@wirelessinnovation.org
    and filling in the relevant values.

    The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the copyright to
    your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our
    codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your
    code. We also need to be sure of various other thingsâ€”-for
    instance that you'll tell us if you know that your code infringes
    on other people's patents.

2.  Before contributing, you will need to become a member or observer
    to the Wireless Innovation Forum. See http://wirelessinnovation.org
    This will require, among other things, agreeing to the Intellectual
    Property Rights Policy governing source code produced by the Forum,
    which applies to this repository. That policy can be found at:
    http://www.wirelessinnovation.org/assets/documents/policy_on_intellectual_property_rights.pdf

3.  Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should
    get in touch with us first through the issue tracker with your
    idea so that we can help out and possibly guide you. Coordinating
    up front makes it much easier to avoid frustration later on.

4.  All submissions, including submissions by project members, require
    review. We use Github pull requests for this purpose.

    Within code submissions, this header should be included in all
    original files:
