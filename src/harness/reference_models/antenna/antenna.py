"""Antenna gain routines for SAS.

Typical usage:
  # Get the gains for a given antenna horizontal pattern.
  # To be used for ESC and CBSD with actual antenna patterns.
  gains = GetAntennaPatternGains(hor_dirs, ant_azimuth, pattern)

  # Get CBSD antenna gain (from antenna defined by beamwidth and gain only).
  gains = GetStandardAntennaGains(hor_dirs, ant_azimuth, beamwidth, ant_gain)

  # Get Radar normalized antenna gain for DPA protection.
  gains = GetRadarNormalizedAntennaGains(hor_dirs, radar_azimuth)

  # Get FSS earth station antenna gains
  gains = GetFssAntennaGains(hor_dirs, ver_dirs,
                             fss_azimuth, fss_elevation, fss_ant_gain)
