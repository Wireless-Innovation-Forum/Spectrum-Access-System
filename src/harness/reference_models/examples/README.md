# Set of examples on reference models libraries

This directory gives some example usage of the reference model libraries.
For now:

  - `example_fss_interference.py`: example of RSSI calculation for a FSS

It also provides useful constructs that can be used for testing the reference
models.

The `benchmark/` subdirectory provides benchmark scripts.

Code here is not supposed to be run in combination of SAS test harness: it
is just to illustrate how to call some of the reference models routines.
