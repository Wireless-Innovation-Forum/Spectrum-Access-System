"""Script for profiling the propagation model timing.

Usage:
  To profile per function:
     python -m cProfile -s cumulative prof_prop.py > fn_profile.txt

  To profile per line:
    - put @profile decorator on functions to be profiled
    - run:
      kernprof -l -v prof_prop.py > line_profile.txt
