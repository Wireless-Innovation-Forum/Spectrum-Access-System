"""CatA outdoor maximum antenna height utility.

Computes the maximum allowed height for CatA outdoor, since CatA outdoor
shall not use an antenna height of 6m or higher above the HAAT (and should be
registered as CatB in that case).

Usage:
  from reference_models.tools import cata_max_height
  max_height = cata_max_height.GetCatAOutdoorMaxHeight(lat, lon)

The tool can also be called on the command line:
  python cata_max_height.py 45 -73

  Returns:

    height in AGL (Above Ground Level) and AMSL (Above Mean Sea Level) formats.
