### DPA Margin simulation & analysis

This `dpa_margin_sim.py` script provides a simulation of the DPA test harness process 
for purpose of analyzing the pass/fail criteria of the test harness.
It has 2 modes of operations:

  - standalone simulator: analysis of a IPR/MCP or reg/grant configuration, and required
  margin that is necessary.
  - test harness log analyzer: analysis of DPA CSV logs produced during IPR/MCP runs, and
  post analysis of results obtained.
 
See the script docstring for precise description of setup and modeling capabilities.
