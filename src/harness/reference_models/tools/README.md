# Tools library

Code here is not supposed to be run directly in combination of SAS test harness.
Instead it provides:
 
  - some example usage of the reference model: 
    * `example_fss_interference.py`: example of RSSI calculation for a FSS
    
  - useful routines for unit testing reference models
  
  - benchmarking scripts: see `benchmark/` subdirectory
  
  - various tools for generating configuration
