  Compute Interference caused by a grant for all the incumbent types
  APIs in this file are used by IAP and Aggregate Interference Reference Models

  The main routines are:

    computeInterference
    computeInterferencePpaGwpzPoint
    computeInterferenceEsc
    computeInterferenceFssCochannel
    computeInterferenceFssBlocking
    getEffectiveSystemEirp

  The common utility APIs are:

    findOverlappingGrantsInsideNeighborhood
    getProtectedChannels

  The routines return a interference caused by a grant in the neighborhood of
  FSS/GWPZ/PPA/ESC incumbent types
