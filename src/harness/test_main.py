# A simple strategy is proposed by default, knowing the test harness usage:
#   - NLCD only used for PPA and GWPZ for deriving the Land Cover. Area size
#     is limited in general. LandCover extraction is done in main thread only
#     (except for PPA tests where worker processes check the CBSD landcover)
#     ==> Allocate most of the cache to main processes
#   - NED used by all others, with heavy terrain profile reading by the main
#     and worker threads.
#     ==> Allocate equal memory to worker processes, and twice to main process
# This strategy could be tuned for best performance.
#
# A 2 level cache could also be used (with memmap or otherwise) in order to share
# most of the in-memory tiles across processes. Not implemented.
