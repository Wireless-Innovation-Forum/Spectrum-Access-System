# This script parses the KML file in the FCC border definition expressed
# as a series of folders of point/linestring placemarks and translates
# the provided set of placemarks into a LineString definition. This is then
# re-exported as a new KML file. The coordinates used in the translations
# are those provided in the coordinates tags of the placemarks. The combination
# of different folders of placemarks is done by comparing (stringwise) the
# first and last coordinates of the coordinates, and if they are identical,
# splicing the coordinate lists together.
