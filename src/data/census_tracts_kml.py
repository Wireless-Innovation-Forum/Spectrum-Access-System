# This script retrieves and processes tiger/shapefiles from the US Census
# to create KML files with polygons describing the census tracts.
# The polygons are labeled with the GEOID attribute of the census tracts,
# and the ALAND and AWATER attributes are translated to metadata
# attached to the placemark.
# Placemarks each contain a MultiGeometry attribute which has one or more
# Polygon geometries inside it. These Polygons may be complex (with outer
# and inner boundaries). The point order of the polygon boundaries follows
# KML guidelines: outer boundaries are clockwise, inner boundaries are
# counter-clockwise.
