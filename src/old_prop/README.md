This is the original implementation of the reference propagation models
purely in Python. 
This has been superseded by the implementation found in 
`src/harness/reference_models/propagation` (for the propagation calculation parts) and `src/harness/reference_models/geo` (for the supporting geo related drivers and libraries).
